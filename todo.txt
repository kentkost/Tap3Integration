Compute translated value.
  Not as easy as it sounds due to having to find type first.
  I guess this is where grammar structure comes in. Not all types are created equal.
  HowTO:
    * Add BaseType to Node.cs
    * In AnyReader.cs whilst reading Data into a structure also find the basetype.
    * Create methods for converting.
    * To Node.cs set TranslatedValue
