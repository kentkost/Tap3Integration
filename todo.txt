Compute translated value.
  Not as easy as it sounds due to having to find type first.
  I guess this is where grammar structure comes in. Not all types are created equal.
  How to:
    * Base type is depending on whether or not the restriction base has xsd namespace.
    * But for BCdstring it is a special case.
    * So create following types:
      * BCDString xsd:hexbinary and simpletype = "BCDString"
      * ASCIIString, Numberstring, etc. xsd:hexbinary
      * Integer xsd:integer
    I don't think other types are used in TAP3
